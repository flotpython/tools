# HOW TO

## Update May 2020

I took some time to move to a more recent version of nbconvert  

* this involved patching `Python.tex` from the output of a mundane  
  `jupyter nbconvert --to latex`  
  I tried to keep this input separate from our local changes

**THIS IS NOT RESOLVED**  

Another problem with inclusion of `.svg` files - that are not natively supported with
latex (they have no boundingbox); this issue turned out to be a gigantic waste of time  
* could not make it with using the {svg} packageÂ :
  * requires to run `xelatex` with the `--shell-escape` option
  * requires separate (and non-trivial) installation of InkScape
  * that in turn requires patching PATH
  * and with all this in place it seems like inkscape now has a new command-line
    interface, and so `includesvg` just won't work as is
* have also seen references to a Python `cairosvg` package 
  * that I could install through `pip install`
  * but that could not load due to a allegedly unknown locale `UTF-8`

So because we only have 4 figures of that sort for now I am just giving up for today.

## Warning:

Historically, I just wanted to ignore a textual output entirely.
However, that primarily never flew.

So. Some day Fangh started to produce pdf on his own; that paved the way, but it
was tedious too, so at some point I came up with something to do it
automatically, so it could be done over and over again.

## The idea

Workflow can be sketched like this:
* execute the notebooks using a customized nbconvert preprocessor
* run nbconvert to produce latex
* use a hand-crafted umbrella `Python.tex`, that was initially produced by nbconvert but, later on heavily patched upon by Fangh - thanks again for that :)
* select actual weeks, inject resulting tex in the mix,
* and run with `pdflatex`

## Caveats

It's not perfect, but it's OK.

Here's a - probably not exhaustive - list of things that work, how they work,
and of things that still could use ironing.

#### Chapter names

At some point we need to define names for the various chapters; this is
currently written manually in a totally *ad hoc* format in
`ChapterNames.txt`.

#### Special tags in cell metadata

We have defined a few cell metadata tags that allow us to work around most
issues as we ran into them:

* `latex:skip-cell` : ignore that cell altogether: don't evaluate,
   don't show in output;
* `latex:skip-eval` : don't evaluate that cell, but keep in output;
* `latex:hidden-code-instead` : this is for cells that expect an input, typically with builtin `input()`; we run this code instead of the actual cell code;
* `latex:hidden-silent` : resulting cell code just says something odd has happened, but does not divulge actual code; typically in conjunction with `latex:hidden-code-instead` for exercises;
* `latex:replace` : allows to replace parts of the source; typically used to deal with characters that were not supported by latex.

**Notes**

* there's also provisions for `latex:hidden-code-before` and
* `latex:hidden-code-after` but I did not need these eventually;
  `latex:replace` was kind of convenient, but it's still a little hacky:

  * first off it does not replace in the cell's outputs - for now, at least;
  * second, this way of dealing with weird symbols turned out a huge waste
    of time; at some point I thought I'd have more power with xelatex
    instead of pdflatex, but then some other parts stopped working as well,
    so after a while I decided I did not care too much about these - very
    few - places that needed attention, as long as the latex step runs fine.

#### Remaining known issues

* **URLs:** Fangh suggests using proper links when inserting a URL; inserting a URL as-is works in the web, but results in a poor pdf output.

## Workflow

* get the list of available notebooks
* each of them goes through `nbcustomexec.py`, that outputs a copy locally here under `work/name.ipynb`
* run `nbconvert --to latex` to produce `work/name.tex`
* run `striplatex.py` to keep just valuable contents, between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`
* run `scopecontents.py` that overwrites `contents.tex` according to the weeks of interest

* finally process `Python.tex` as usual - several times, that is, to get the page numbering right.

All this is for now only partially automated. Here are a few hints:

#### preparation

*  define this to point at your main course repo

```
COURSEDIR=$HOME/git/flotpython-course
TOOLSDIR=$HOME/git/flotpython-tools
```

* prepare work area & symlinks

```
mkdir -p work
for symlink in media data; do
    ln -sf $COURSEDIR/$symlink work
done
```

*****

*****

#### load tools utilities

This file is at the root of the flotpython-tools repo

```
source ../bashrc-utils
```

#### execute notebook_names

```
execute-all
```

This command will recompute all executed notebooks;
  * it does this lazily (compares modification times)
  * WARNING: this will **not** remove old stuff in case of a renaming
  * its safe to trash `work` altogether in case of doubt; it takes a few minutes to recompute the whole stuff though.

#### convert to $\LaTeX$

```
convert-all
```

Likewise:

* does this lazily by comparing modification times,
* this will actually run a pipeline of `nbconvert --to latex` and `striplatex.py`,
* the latter being in charge of
  * (a) removing extra header and footer stuff, and
  * (b) tweaking the output to suit our aesthetic tastes.

#### selecting scope - in weeks

```
scopecontents.py
# or
scopecontents.py 1 5
# or
scopecontents.py --from 1 --to 6
```

#### rebuild

```
latex-all
```

Run several times (twice should be enough, 3 times to be safe) - as always, to get cross references - like table of contents - right.

#### shortcut

```
pdf-all
```

just does `execute-all` + `convert-all` + `latex-all`

#### the full monty

In principle, producing all pdf's up to, say, week 6, can be achieved with

```
week-all 6
```
which would recompute the following files - stored in `pdf/` and not in `work/`:

* `Python-w6.pdf`,
* `Python-w1-to-w6.pdf`,


```
weeks-all-upto 6
```

is equivalent to `for week in $(seq 6); do week-all $week; done`
