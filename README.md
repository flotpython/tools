This repo contains the miscellaneous tools written over the course of the MOOC on Python3, running on fun-mooc.fr

It does cover pdf generation, as per Fangh's contribution, that started as part of the 2017 recreative repo

It does not cover either nbautoeval, nor nbhosting, that are each in a separate repo of their own
